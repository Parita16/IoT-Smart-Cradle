This project aims to solve the challenge of monitoring babies for working parents by proposing an IoT-based baby monitoring system for a smart cradle. The smart cradle is equipped with a fan, a musical toy, and automatic swinging support. This system will be able to monitor baby's condition in terms of various parameters such as crying, moisture, and temperature and it will automatically perform appropriate actions when some parameters exceed their threshold values. Additionally, parents will be able to see live data captured by sensors and the state of various actuators through a user interface and they could control the fan, musical toy and the swinging of the cradle remotely from anywhere and anytime.
